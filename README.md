## A note about `create-react-app`

For larger, production-ready applications, React's official documentation and best practices now recommend other ways to [Start a New React Project](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project). 
This was a project for learning purposes, with no plans to scale this project out or add further customization, so [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) provided a simple way to quickly get a functional React app up and running
